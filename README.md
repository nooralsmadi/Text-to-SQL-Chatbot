- Instead of manually mapping natural language queries to SQL queries, we used the Gemma model to translate the queries automatically.

- The Gradio library was used to implement the user interface (UI), making it interactive and user-friendly.

- We utilized Ollama to interact with the Gamma model for seamless integration.
